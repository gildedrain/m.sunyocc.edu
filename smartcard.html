      <h4>Using Your SMART CARD Off Campus</h4>
      <p>You can now use your SMART CARD for&#160;<a title="Using Your SMART CARD Off Campus" href="#">purchases off campus</a>&#160;at participating businesses.&#160; </p>
      <h4><br />FAQ's for the SMART CARD</h4>
      <h5><br />What is the SMART CARD?</h5>
      <p>The&#160;SMART CARD&#160;is the official identification card of Onondaga Community College as well as the only way to access the residence halls if you reside there. The Smart Card also features a convenient, pre-paid debit account option for making purchases on campus.&#160; You can also complete many transactions online using the NetCardManager portal.&#160;&#160;<a title="NetCard Manager Documentation" href="#">NetCardManager directions</a> (.pdf)&#160;</p>
      <h5>Where is the SMART CARD issued?&#160;</h5>
      <p>SMART CARDS&#160;are issued at the&#160;<a title="SMART CARD Office" href="#">SMART CARD office</a> in the Gordon Student Center room 129.&#160; You can also avoid long lines by <a title="Email Your Student ID Card Photo" href="#">submitting your ID photo by email</a>. </p>
      <h5>What do I do if I lose my SMART CARD?</h5>
      <p><em>Please Note: You are responsible for reporting a lost card.</em>&#160;</p>
      <p>A lost card can be reported in one of 2 ways:</p>
      <p>If you lose your&#160;SMART CARD&#160;call Campus Security at 498-2478, or if during hours of operation the Smart Card office at 498-7230 immediately.&#160; After the card is reported lost it will be deactivated.</p>
      <p>Or</p>
      <p>You can report your card lost by logging into&#160;<a title="NetCardManager" href="#" target="_blank">NetCardManager</a>&#160;using your OCC e-mail address and OCC network password.&#160; Once you are logged into the system select Report a Lost Card from the left tool bar. You'll be asked Do you want to report your card as lost? Select Yes.</p>
      <p>The only way to protect your funds on the card and the access to your residence hall building is to report the card lost as soon as possible. To obtain a new card a $26 fee would need to be paid at the Bursars office and a receipt of this payment presented to the Card Office for reissuing. Your account will remain the same, and any existing funds that were on the card when it was inactivated will remain.</p>
